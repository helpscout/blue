        <p>
          On Christmas Eve in 1973, an infant boy stows away in Santa Claus'
          sack. When discovered back at the North Pole, he is adopted by Papa
          Elf. Papa Elf names his son Buddy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Buddy grows up at the North Pole believing he is an elf, but due to
          his human size he is unable to perform elf tasks. When Buddy
          accidentally learns that he is human, Papa Elf explains that he was
          born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells, and was given up for adoption
          without Walter knowing. Susan died and Walter works at a children's
          book publisher in New York City at the Empire State Building. Santa
          notes that Walter is on the naughty list due to his greed and
          selfishness, but suggests Buddy could help redeem him, and so Buddy
          travels alone to New York.
        </p>

        <p>
          Buddy has trouble acclimating to the customs of the human world. Buddy
          finds his father's office, but Walter has him ejected after Buddy
          mentions Susan Wells. After following a security guard's sarcastic
          suggestion to go "back to Gimbels" due to his elf outfit, the Gimbels'
          manager mistakes him for an employee at Santa Land. He meets Jovie, an
          unenthused employee to whom he is attracted. Knowing that Santa will
          arrive the next day, Buddy stays behind and spends the night
          decorating Santa Land, and buys a nightie for Walter.
        </p>

        <p>
          The next day, Buddy is appalled that the store's Santa is not real and
          rips off the man's fake beard, causing them to fight, with the manager
          having to subdue the fake Santa. Walter bails Buddy out of prison and
          takes him to Dr. Leonardo for a DNA test, which confirms that Buddy is
          Walter's son. The doctor convinces him to take Buddy home to meet his
          step-mother Emily and 11-year-old half-brother Michael. Walter and
          Michael are annoyed by Buddy's childlike behavior, but Emily insists
          that they take care of him until he "recovers".
        </p>

        <p>
          Buddy wins Michael over by helping him defeat a gang of bullies in a
          snowball fight and Michael encourages Buddy to ask Jovie out. Walter
          learns from his boss Fulton Greenway that his company is in financial
          trouble after publishing a failed children's book, and organizes a
          book pitch for Christmas Eve, for which Walter and his associates
          Eugene and Morris arrange a meeting with best-selling children's
          author Miles Finch to hire him.
        </p>

        <p>
          One night, Buddy goes on a date with Jovie and wins her over. On
          Christmas Eve, Buddy bursts into Walter's office during a meeting with
          Finch to tell Walter about his love, and mistakes Finch, who has
          dwarfism for an elf. Finch loses his temper and attacks Buddy before
          storming out, causing Walter to harshly disown Buddy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eugene and Morris find a notebook Finch left that is filled with ideas
          for children's books. Walter pitches these ideas to Greenway, but
          Michael bursts in to tell Walter that Buddy ran away. Greenway refuses
          to reschedule; Walter quits his job and leaves to find Buddy.
