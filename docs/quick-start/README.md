# Quick start

This guide will show you how to get started with Blue!

## Installation

The first thing you'll need to do, is add Blue to your React project. This can be done by adding the [latest version](https://github.com/helpscout/hsds-react/releases) to your `package.json` file.

Or, even faster, you can run:

```
npm install @helpscout/hsds-react --save
```

## React (v16.8+)

HSDS has a couple of `peerDependencies`:

- [`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [`react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

Make sure you have these installed in your project.

Blue currently runs on **React version 16**.

### Future of CSS-in-Blue

We're moving towards a CSS-in-JS future, powered by [Styled component](https://styled-components.com/).
