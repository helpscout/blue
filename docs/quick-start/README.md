# Quick start

This guide will show you how to get started with Blue!

## Installation

The first thing you'll need to do, is add Blue to your React project. This can be done by adding the [latest version](https://github.com/helpscout/hsds-react/releases) to your `package.json` file.

Or, even faster, you can run:

```
npm install @helpscout/hsds-react --save
```

## React (v15)

Blue has a couple of `peerDependencies`:

- [`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [`react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

Make sure you have these installed in your project.

Blue currently runs on **React version 15**. Work is being done to add compatibility with 16+. ðŸ’ª

### Future of CSS-in-Blue

We're moving towards a CSS-in-JS future, powered by [Fancy](https://github.com/helpscout/fancy), our custom CSS-in-JS solution (which uses [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) under the hood).

Let's start using some [components](components.md)!
