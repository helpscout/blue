# Write a story

In this guide, we'll walk through render our newly [styled](styling.md) [custom `Strong` component](creating.md) in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Initial files

The first thing we'll need to do is create a dedicated `Strong` directory under `stories/`:

```
hsds-react/
  └── stories/
      └── Strong/
        └── Strong.stories.mdx
```

## Next

Let's [write some tests](testing.md) to make sure `Strong` works as we expect it to. (Just in case!)
