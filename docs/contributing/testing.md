# Writing tests

In this guide, we'll walk through writing test for our [custom `Strong` component](creating.md) in [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

HSDS uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) for testing.

## Directory

All of HSDS's component test files are scoped in the same directory as the component, example:

```
hsds-react/
  └── components/
      └── Strong/
          └── Strong.test.js
```

## Base test code

In our `Strong.test.js` file, we'll need to add:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { mount } from 'enzyme'
import Strong from '../Strong'

describe('classNames', () => {
  test('Has default className', () => {
    const wrapper = mount(<Strong />)
    const el = wrapper.find('Strong')

    expect(el.hasClass('c-Strong')).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

#### `mount`

HSDS favours [mount rendering vs. shallow rendering](https://blog.kentcdodds.com/why-i-never-use-shallow-rendering-c08851a68bb7) for testing. The benefits are many. The only downside is `mount` is slightly slower compared to `shallow`.

## Test development

For test development, open up your terminal and run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This fires up Jest in watch mode, and runs tests against modified files (and their associated files).

## Code coverage

![Coverage report, generated by Jest](../images/test-coverage.jpg)

To check code coverage, run the following command:

```
npm run test
```

This runs through the entire Jest test suite, and generates a [coverage report](https://istanbul.js.org/) under:

```
hsds-react/
  └── coverage/
      └── lcov-report/
          └── index.html
```

You can open the `index.html` in your browser to view the full report.

## Coverage

We strive to have as much coverage as posible, and for that purpose we set the threshold at 95% coverage.

Why not 100%? 100% coverage is a false metric and it does not indicate whether your component is _properly_ tested, and while we maintained 100% coverage for a long period we noticed an excessive usage of `istanbul ignore` directives, this wasn't because of lazyness but because some things are close to impossible to test in the Jest/JSDOM environment or because `istanbul` couldn't reach the code for some reason.

## Next

Let's [write some documentation](documentation.md) to make sure other folks know how to use `Strong`.
