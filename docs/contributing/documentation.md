# Adding documentation

In this guide, we'll walk through adding documentation for our [fully test](testing.md) [custom `Strong` component](creating.md).

## Directory

All of HSDS's component documenations files are scoped in the same directory as the component, example:

```
hsds-react/
  â””â”€â”€ components/
      â””â”€â”€ Button/
          â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Initial file

The first thing we'll need to do is create a `README.md` directory under `Strong/`:

```
hsds-react/
  â””â”€â”€ components/
      â””â”€â”€ Strong/
          â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Content

Our `README.md` documentation should contain:

* Brief explanation of what the component is/doesn
* An example of how it can be used
* Descriptions of the available component `prop`

Check out any `README.md` file from [any component](https://github.com/helpscout/hsds-react/tree/master/src/components) for some examples.

Yay, you did it ðŸ¤—! Documentation is [super important](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-documentation-important-in-programming). Thank you for taking the time to write docs!

## Next

Let's submit our component for [review](review.md)!
