# Submitting for review

In this guide, we'll walk through submitting an HSDS: React related update for code review!

## Create a pull request

An HSDS: React integration update almost always involves a version bump.

When writing your pull request description, include the areas of effect (AoE) the version bump may change within your application.

Refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/helpscout/hsds-react/releases) for update details. It's also a good idea to link to release version to provide context to code reviewers.

## Assigning Reviewers

If the update involves UI or interaction changes, we recommend you `@` a designer for approval. Depending on the size/scope of your change, we encourage you to `@` a QA (Quality Assurance) as well.

Regardless of the folks you `@` for review, it's always a good idea to help set them up for success.

This may include:

* Providing a checklist for steps to check the update
* Including a direct link to a deploy preview/staging environment
* Attaching screenshots/GIFs of any visual/interaction changes
* Recording a short screencast that goes over the updates
