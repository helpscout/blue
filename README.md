## Blue?

On Nov 8, 2018, we rebranded Blue to HSDS: React :tada:.

The original [Blue](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@helpscout/blue) library will still exist on npm, and is still installable via:

```
npm install @helpscout/blue --save
```

However, continued development of this component library will continue under HSDS: React, which is installable via:

```
npm install @helpscout/hsds-react --save
```

A big thanks to all the folks involved in Blue! Blue will always be your boy :blue_heart: .
