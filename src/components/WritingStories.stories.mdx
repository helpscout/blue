# Guidelines for writing good stories

In the past we have used stories as sort of a development playground or lab, and have written stories that showcase every single scenario, from simple to _very_ complex for each component.

The most important thing to remember when writing stories is that HSDS's Storybook is in fact the central documentation place for designers and developers to see how a component looks, interact with it and obtain information on how to use it.

With this in mind, we should strive to write simple stories that cover the main use cases for each component.

Storybook _is_ a great developer environment to work on while building components, feel free to use it as you see fit during this stage, but when it comes to commiting your work to HSDS, make sure to only include stories that document the component main use and common variations.

## Knobs

Using the storybook add-on "knobs", we can write simple yet very interactive stories that cover most use cases of a component in one single story.

So when to write a separate story? Use your judgement for when using a knob suffices or if the feature is better showcased in a separate story. Have a look at what we currently have and make the call.

## MDX

All stories are written in `mdx`, a format that allows to write prose in Markdown and bring `react` components usign `jsx`.

The mdx parser is sometimes a little funny, specially in the `jsx` blocks, for example, having a blank line trips it up, like:

```jsx
<Card>
  <p>Something here</p>

  <button>OK</button>
</Card>
```

Something like the above will throw an error, and there might be other similar cases so just be aware of that. Fortunately we have `Prettier` in place that will format your `mdx` just like markdown or javascript and take care of some of the issues (not all though).

Also, mdx allows _some_ javascript to be run, but not everything can be. If you need to have more js power, create a `YourComponent.storiesHelpers.js` and import from there 💪.

## Structure of a Story

```
  // YourComponent.stories.mdx

  👇 Storybook's components to render stories
  import { Meta, Story, Props, Preview } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'

  👇 The "knobs" you'd like to use
  import { boolean, number } from '@storybook/addon-knobs'

  👇 If you want to showcase "actions" (logs the outcome of an action in a separate tab, use sparingly, in my experience is VERY slow 🤷‍♀️)
  import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions'

  👇 Your component
  import YourComponent from './'

  👇 You can bring other components and use them in your stories
  import { Button, Heading, Link, Text } from '../index'

  <Meta
    title="🧬 Components/Text/YourComponent" 👈 Find the correct path to where your story should be located in the storybook
    component={YourComponent}
    parameters={{
      design: {
        type: 'figma',
        url:
          'https://www.figma.com/file/Wp9mDx', 👈 The link to the Figma design, provided by a designer.
      },
    }}
  />

  # YourComponent

  Component's description and any notes worth mentioning

  👇 Default story, a lot of the time this is all is needed
  <Preview>
    <Story name="default">
      <YourComponent
        shadow={boolean('shadow', false)}
        seamless={boolean('seamless', false)}
        theme={select(
          'Theme',
          {
            default: 'default',
            note: 'note',
          },
          'default'
        )}
      >Buddy!</YourComponent>
    </Story>
  </Preview>

  <br />
  <br />

  ### Props

  <Props of={YourComponent} /> 👈 This generates the "prop types" table, be sure to document them directly in the component file.

  ## Stories 👈 Write as many stories as you see fit, whenever you feel knobs are not enough or the right way to go.

  #### Wild mode

  <Preview>
    <Story name="wild mode">
      <YourComponent wildMode={true} />
    </Story>
  </Preview>

  #### Disco mode

  <Preview>
    <Story name="disco mode">
      <YourComponent discoMode={true} />
    </Story>
  </Preview>
```

## Component generator

Using the provided component generator npm script creates a template that includes all of this for you (together with the component jsx, css and test files).

```bash
  npm run remake --name="YourComponent"
```

> Too late to use the generator? Grab the template (hint use the copy button at the bottom of the block):

```
import { Meta, Story, Props, Preview } from '@storybook/addon-docs/blocks'
import { boolean, number } from '@storybook/addon-knobs'
import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions'
import YourComponent from './'

<Meta
  title="🧬 Components/Text/YourComponent"
  component={YourComponent}
  parameters={{
    design: {
      type: 'figma',
      url: ''
    },
  }}
/>
