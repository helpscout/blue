# Dropdown

A Dropdown component is provides the UI to contain a series of actions, presented in a menu overlay.

## Version 2

[DropdownV2](./V2/docs/) was added on November 16, 2018. It's better in every way compared to the original implementation of Dropdown. However, it is **not** backwards compatible.

It must be imported like so:

```jsx
import Dropdown from '@helpscout/hsds-react/components/Dropdown/DropdownV2'
```

Check out the [docs for V2](./V2/docs/).

## Components

The Dropdown component is comprised of smaller components:

* [Dropdown](./docs/Dropdown.md)
* [Trigger](./docs/Trigger.md)
* [Menu](./docs/Menu.md)
* [Item](./docs/Item.md)
* [Divider](./docs/Divider.md)
