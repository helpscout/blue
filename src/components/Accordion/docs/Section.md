# Section

This component is part of the graphical control element that is the `Accordion`.
The `Section` houses a `Title` and `Body`. When the `Section` is open its
`Body` is expanded, otherwise its `Body` is collapsed.

Each section is assigned an auto-generated uuid which is used to track the
open state of the section. You may optionally set an `id` prop which will be
used instead of the uuid. This allows for programatic control of accordion
sections using known id values.

This component is to be used within an [`Accordion`](./Accordion.md).

## Example

```jsx
<Accordion>
  <Accordion.Section>...</Accordion.Section>
  ...
</Accordion>
```
