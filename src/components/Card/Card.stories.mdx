# Card

A Card component is used to encapsulate pieces of UI that share a common concept or action.

<Preview>
  <Story name="default">
    <Card>Hello, this is a card</Card>
  </Story>
</Preview>

### Props

<Props of={Card} />

### Stories

#### With link

If a `to` or `href` prop is passed into the Card component, it will render the `Link` component, which provides additional link-based props.

<Preview>
  <Story name="with link">
    <Card href="https://www.helpscout.net/">
      Link to: https://www.helpscout.net/
    </Card>
  </Story>
</Preview>

#### Floating

<Preview>
  <Story name="Floating">
    <Card floating hover>
      Hello, this is a floating hoverable card
    </Card>
  </Story>
</Preview>

## Card.Block

A Card.Block component is used to section content within a [`<Card>`](../Card).

Note: It is highly recommended the `seamless` prop is used for the container `<Card>`. This allows for the `<Card.Block>` components to flow all the way to the inner-edges of `<Card>`.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Card Blocks">
    <Card seamless>
      <Card.Block>Frank "The Tank"</Card.Block>
      <Card.Block>You're my boy, Blue!</Card.Block>
    </Card>
  </Story>
</Preview>
