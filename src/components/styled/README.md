# styled

This is an adapter for [Fancy](https://github.com/helpscout/fancy), which provides some flexibility for how Fancy is consumed within HSDS: React.

As a bonus, it makes migrating away from Fancy easier, if we ever choose to swap Fancy out with another CSS-in-JS equivalent (with a similar API).

See [Fancy's documentation](https://github.com/helpscout/fancy) for more details.
