# Core Values

HSDS is a resource for designers and engineers that follows these principles:

- The source of truth for UI components at Help Scout.
- One of the goals fo HSDS is to make it possible to componentize the front-end.
- It strives to be unambiguous, so there should not be multiple variations of the same component.
- We design and develop thinking for the short term, keeping things simple and iteratively adding features as we need them.
- Empowering contributors by minimizing the amount of blockers and hurdles.
- Contributors should be confident to push back on design or changes to an existent component within HSDS (there should be a valid reason for a new component/variant)
- The insights from engineering and design hold equal weight. Questions, input and advice are always welcome.
- Hold people accountable and make collaboration easier by providing points of contact for each component (who designed and who coded) and which part of the product is using it.
