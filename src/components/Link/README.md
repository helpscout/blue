# Link

A Link component is a light-weight wrapper for the default HTML `<a>` selector. This component supports [`react-router`](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

## Example

```jsx
You're my boy, <Link href="https://github.com/helpscout/hsds-react">Blue</Link>!
```

### Router Link

This component is extended by the `RouteWrapper` higher order component, and can be used similarly to a [`react-router` `<Link>`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Link) component by using the `to` prop. It also has an optional `fetch` property which can specify a promise-returning function which will be invoked before the `to` route is navigated

```jsx
You're my boy, <Link fetch={fetchBlueData} to="/blue">Blue</Link>!
```
