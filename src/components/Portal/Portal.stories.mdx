# Portal

A Portal component provides the ability to mount components at the root `<body>` level of the DOM, regardless of their current location in the DOM tree. This is useful for interactions like Modals or Popovers.

## Example

```jsx
<Portal>
  <Card>Happy! Happy! Ha ha ha ha!</Card>
</Portal>
```

## Customize mounting selector

By default, Portal renders elements into the root `<body>` of the page. However, this can be customized by:

1. Passing the CSS query of the selector you wish for Portal to mount to.
2. Using the `<Portal.Container>` component somewhere in your React app.

### 1. Custom selector example

In this example, our Portal content will render within the `div.zoolander` selector.

```jsx
<App>
  <Main>
    <Portal renderTo=".zoolander">
      <Card>Happy! Happy! Ha ha ha ha!</Card>
    </Portal>
  </Main>
  <div className="zoolander" />
</App>
```

### 2. Portal.Container example

In this example, our Portal content will render within the `<Portal.Container>` component.

```jsx
<App>
  <Main>
    <Portal renderTo=".zoolander">
      <Card>Happy! Happy! Ha ha ha ha!</Card>
    </Portal>
  </Main>
  <Portal.Container />
</App>
```

- Note: If the `renderTo` selector or `<Portal.Container>` component cannot be found/accessed, Portal will fallback to `<body>`.

#### `onBeforeOpen`

`onBeforeOpen` returns a function with a single argument. The argument is the callback function that will trigger the Portal to render (open).

This was designed to allow you to render Portal after async actions or Promises.

```jsx
const MyComponent = props => {
  const onBeforeOpen = (open) => {
    // Custom functions
    open()
  }

  return (
    <Portal onBeforeOpen={onBeforeOpen} />
      <Card>
        Happy! Happy! Ha ha ha ha!
      </Card>
    </Portal>
  )
}
```

#### `onBeforeClose`

`onBeforeClose` returns a function with a single argument. The argument is the callback function that will trigger the Portal to about to unmount (close).

This was designed to allow you to render Portal after async actions or Promises.

```jsx
const MyComponent = props => {
  const onBeforeClose = (close) => {
    // Custom functions
    close()
  }

  return (
    <Portal onBeforeClose={onBeforeClose} />
      <Card>
        Happy! Happy! Ha ha ha ha!
      </Card>
    </Portal>
  )
}
```
