# Header

A SideNavigation.Item component is a button-based component used within [SideNavigation](../README.md).
This component could point to a url, or have a onClick event attach to it so we can do custom interaction.

## Example

```jsx
<SideNavigation>
  <SideNavigation.Section>
    <SideNavigation.Item icon={<Icon name="user" />} count={25}>
      Item #1
    </SideNavigation.Item>
    <SideNavigation.Item href="https://google.com/">
      Item #2
    </SideNavigation.Item>
  </SideNavigation.Section>
</SideNavigation>
```
