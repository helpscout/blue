# Datepicker

Renders a calendar that allows picking a date.

Features:

- Navigate to next and previous month
- Navigate to a given month within the currently selected year
- Navigate to a year inside a range
- Disable selecting dates in the future
- Pass a starting date to be selected

Notes:

Datepicker uses [@datepicker-react/hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@datepicker-react/hooks) to handle (most of) the calendar logic. For future reference and features it supports:

- Date range selection
- Blocking specific dates
- Multiple month view

Implementing these features in `Datepicker` should be straightforward ðŸ¤ž and only added as needed.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default">
    <Datepicker
      allowFutureDatePick={boolean('allowFutureDatePick', true)}
      firstDayOfWeek={select(
        'first Day Of Week',
        {
          sunday: 0,
          monday: 1,
          tuesday: 2,
          wednesday: 3,
          thursday: 4,
          friday: 5,
          saturday: 6,
        },
        1
      )}
      startDate={select(
        'Start date',
        {
          unselected: null,
          today: new Date().toString(),
          '25/03/1982': new Date(1982, 2, 25).toString(),
        },

      )}

- **Navigator**: Handles the calendar navigation
  - Single step (month by month, year by year, year range by year range depending on the navigation level) using the arrow buttons
  - Skip to any month faster by using the "deep navigator button"
  - Skip to any year faster by using the "deep navigator button" again
- **Month**: Renders a month inside `DailyCalendar`
- **Day**: Renders a day inside `Month`
